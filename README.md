# Oh My Stars
<p> A webapp, the first of many to come... </p>


### Live at
<a href="https://justsamguy.github.io/oh-my-stars/" target="_blank">https://justsamguy.github.io/oh-my-stars/</a>

### Beta at
<a href="#" target="_blank"></a>

### Roadmap
<li> site tree for live/development versions of the site - dev version can be a sub-page (links to both in readme)
<li> review and adjust star size diversity
<li> real-time dynamically adjust viewport size
<li> add a subtle smooth scroll-up effect upon initial load (desktop only)
<li> Dark mode on site: Make the entire view crack into peices, and then fall down revealing a light theme, maybe with a static grey image texture in the background (solid white for now). To return to dark mode, simply fade back into the stars.
<li> Camera-move-to-POI feature: Use cameraTargetY (currently unused) to smoothly animate the camera to a selected POI when this feature is implemented.

<p> This project was made using a macro-edit approach instead of code-test-commit because of it's reliance on js and me not wanting to mess with browser security to run locally imported code. </p>

<p> This project was made using a macro-edit approach instead of code-test-commit because of it's reliance on js and me not wanting to mess with browser security to run locally imported code. </p>

Ideas
<li> add a subtle smooth scroll-up effect upon initial load (desktop only)
<li> Dark mode on site: Make the entire view crack into peices, and then fall down revealing a light theme, maybe with a static grey image texture in the background (solid white for now). To return to dark mode, simply fade back into the stars.
<li> Camera-move-to-POI feature: Use cameraTargetY (currently unused) to smoothly animate the camera to a selected POI when this feature is implemented.

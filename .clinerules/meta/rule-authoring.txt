description: Guidelines for creating and maintaining Cline rules to ensure consistency.
globs: .clinerules/**/*.txt
alwaysApply: true
---

- **Required Rule Structure:**
  ```markdown
  ---
  description: Clear, one-line description of what the rule enforces
  globs: path/to/files/*.ext, other/path/**/*
  alwaysApply: boolean
  ---

  - **Main Points in Bold**
    - Sub-points with details
    - Examples and explanations
  ```

- **File References:**
  - Use `[filename](mdc:path/to/file)` ([filename](mdc:filename)) to reference files
  - Example: [prisma.mdc](mdc:.clinerules/prisma.mdc) for rule references
  - Example: [schema.prisma](mdc:prisma/schema.prisma) for code references

- **Code Examples:**
  - Use language-specific code blocks
  ```typescript
  // ✅ DO: Show good examples
  const goodExample = true;

  // ❌ DON'T: Show anti-patterns
  const badExample = false;
  ```

- **Rule Content Guidelines:**
  - Start with high-level overview
  - Include specific, actionable requirements
  - Show examples of correct implementation
  - Reference existing code when possible
  - Keep rules DRY by referencing other rules

- **Tailoring Rules for Web Rendering Applications:**
  - **JavaScript Module Best Practices:**
    - Write rules that encourage clear `export` and `import` statements.
    - Emphasize single responsibility for modules (e.g., `interaction.js` handles interactions, `poi.js` handles POIs).
    - Suggest consistent naming conventions for exported functions and variables.
    - Example Rule Idea: "Modules should export related functionality."
  - **Web Interaction Patterns:**
    - Create rules for consistent handling of mouse, touch, scroll, and resize events.
    - Include guidelines for managing event listeners (adding and removing them to prevent memory leaks).
    - Provide examples for rules related to DOM manipulation based on user interaction.
    - Example Rule Idea: "All event listeners should be properly removed when no longer needed."
  - **Code Structure for Rendering Applications:**
    - Develop rules that guide the organization of code related to the rendering library (e.g., Three.js).
    - Include guidelines for managing the scene, camera, renderer, and 3D objects.
    - Suggest rules for structuring the animation loop and update functions.
    - Example Rule Idea: "Rendering setup and animation logic should be separated."

- **Rule Maintenance:**
  - Update rules when new patterns emerge
  - Add examples from actual codebase
  - Remove outdated patterns
  - Cross-reference related rules

- **Best Practices:**
  - Use bullet points for clarity
  - Keep descriptions concise
  - Include both DO and DON'T examples
  - Reference actual code over theoretical examples
  - Use consistent formatting across rules
  - Format commands for **PowerShell**.
  - When using tools to run commands or make edits, consolidate their uses as much as possible.
  - When analyzing and coming to a conclusion, include 1 or 2 sentences that explain the actions being taken.
  - When something is done, decide if it is a significant enough action to request an image be shared back for further analysis.
  - When editing files, consolidate changes per-file rather than per-rule.
    - Add a one-line summary of the actions taken inside each response for task completion. Examples: "Changed the style of the button in the header to be more prominent"; "Fixed header to fit on screen". Separate multiple actions with a semicolon.

## Implementation Instructions

1. Place this file at the indicated path inside `.clinerules/meta/`.
2. Run **“Cline: Reload Rules”** in VS Code or restart the Cline LSP/CLI so it picks up changes.
3. Edit the `globs` pattern above if your project structure differs.
4. Keep this guideline file under version control so the team shares the same conventions.
